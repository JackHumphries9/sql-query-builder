## About The Project

![Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This is a small little application I made to make our University Project easier. In our databases unit, we needed to write lots of insert queries so I made an app which takes a CSV file uploaded, parses it and truncates it and creates the insert statements from the data.

This code is by far not the prettiest or the best but it was only something which was created in a couple of hours.

(I've also removed the original data from the `tableAtlas` as I didn't want to expose our answers incase the University wanted to reuse this assignment)

With more time, I would have probably written some better code and probably made it more usable and maintainable.
